The Semites named it gimel . The sign is possibly adapted from an Egyptian hieroglyph for a staff sling , which may have been the meaning of the name gimel . Another possibility is that it depicted a camel, the Semitic name for which was gamal . Barry B. Powell , a specialist in the history of writing, states \"It is hard to imagine how gimel = \"camel\" can be derived from the picture of a camel (it may show his hump, or his head and neck!)\". [2]  In the Etruscan language , plosive consonants had no contrastive voicing , so the Greek ' \u0393 ' (Gamma) was adopted into the Etruscan alphabet to represent /k/ . Already in the Western Greek alphabet , Gamma first took a ' ' form in Early Etruscan, then ' ' in Classical Etruscan. In Latin it eventually took the ' c ' form in Classical Latin. In the earliest Latin inscriptions, the letters ' c k q ' were used to represent the sounds /k/ and /\u0261/ (which were not differentiated in writing).  Of these, ' q ' was used to represent /k/ or /\u0261/ before a rounded vowel, ' k ' before ' a ', and ' c ' elsewhere. [3] During the 3rd century BC, a modified character was introduced for /\u0261/ , and ' c ' itself was retained for /k/ . The use of ' c ' (and its variant ' g ') replaced most usages of ' k ' and ' q '.  Hence, in the classical period and after, ' g ' was treated as the equivalent of Greek gamma, and ' c ' as the equivalent of kappa; this shows in the romanization of Greek words, as in '\u039a\u0391\u0394\u039c\u039f\u03a3', '\u039a\u03a5\u03a1\u039f\u03a3', and '\u03a6\u03a9\u039a\u0399\u03a3' came into Latin as ' cadmvs ', ' cyrvs ' and ' phocis ', respectively. Other alphabets have letters homoglyphic to 'c' but not analogous in use and derivation, like the Cyrillic letter Es (\u0421, \u0441) which derives from the lunate sigma , named due to its resemblance to the crescent moon.

The Old English Latin-based writing system was learned from the Celts, apparently of Ireland; hence \u27e8c\u27e9 in Old English also originally represented /k/ ; the Modern English words kin, break, broken, thick , and seek all come from Old English words written with \u27e8c\u27e9: cyn, brecan, brocen, \u00feicc , and s\u00e9oc . However, during the course of the Old English period, /k/ before front vowels ( /e/ and /i/ ) were palatalized , having changed by the tenth century to [t\u0283] , though \u27e8c\u27e9 was still used, as in cir(i)ce, wrecc(e)a . On the continent, meanwhile, a similar phonetic change had also been going on (for example, in Italian ). In Vulgar Latin, /k/ became palatalized to [t\u0283] in Italy and Dalmatia; in France and the Iberian peninsula, it became [ts] . Yet for these new sounds \u27e8 c \u27e9 was still used before the letters \u27e8e\u27e9 and \u27e8i\u27e9.  The letter thus represented two distinct values. Subsequently, the Latin phoneme /k\u02b7/ (spelled \u27e8 qv \u27e9) de-labialized to /k/ meaning that the various Romance languages had /k/ before front vowels.  In addition, Norman used the letter \u27e8k\u27e9 so that the sound /k/ could be represented by either \u27e8k\u27e9 or \u27e8c\u27e9, the latter of which could represent either /k/ or /ts/ depending on whether it preceded a front vowel letter or not. The convention of using both \u27e8c\u27e9 and \u27e8k\u27e9 was applied to the writing of English after the Norman Conquest , causing a considerable re-spelling of the Old English words. Thus while Old English candel, clif, corn, crop, c\u00fa , remained unchanged, Cent, c\u01e3\u1d79 (c\u0113\u1d79), cyng, brece, s\u0113oce , were now (without any change of sound) spelled Kent, ke\u021d, kyng, breke , and seoke ; even cniht ('knight') was subsequently changed to kniht and \u00feic ('thick') changed to thik or thikk . The Old English \u27e8cw\u27e9 was also at length displaced by the French \u27e8qu\u27e9 so that the Old English cw\u0113n ('queen') and cwic ('quick') became Middle English  quen and quik , respectively. The sound [t\u0283] , to which Old English palatalized /k/ had advanced, also occurred in French, chiefly from Latin /k/ before \u27e8a\u27e9. In French it was represented by the digraph \u27e8ch\u27e9, as in champ (from Latin camp-um ) and this spelling was introduced into English: the Hatton Gospels, written c. 1160 , have in Matt. i-iii, child, chyld, riche, mychel , for the cild, rice, mycel, of the Old English version whence they were copied. In these cases, the Old English \u27e8c\u27e9 gave way to \u27e8k\u27e9, \u27e8qu\u27e9 and \u27e8ch\u27e9; on the other hand, \u27e8c\u27e9 in its new value of /ts/ appeared largely in French words like processiun, emperice and grace , and was also substituted for \u27e8ts\u27e9 in a few Old English words, as miltse, bletsien , in early Middle English milce, blecien . By the end of the thirteenth century both in France and England, this sound /ts/ de-affricated to /s/ ; and from that time \u27e8c\u27e9 has represented /s/ before front vowels either for etymological reasons, as in lance, cent , or to avoid the ambiguity due to the \"etymological\" use of \u27e8s\u27e9 for /z/ , as in ace, mice, once, pence, defence . Thus, to show etymology, English spelling has advise , devise (instead of *advize , *devize ), while advice, device, dice, ice, mice, twice , etc., do not reflect etymology; example has extended this to hence, pence, defence , etc., where there is no etymological reason for using \u27e8c\u27e9. Former generations also wrote sence for sense . Hence, today the Romance languages and English have a common feature inherited from Vulgar Latin spelling conventions where \u27e8c\u27e9 takes on either a \"hard\" or \"soft\" value depending on the following letter.

However, there are a number of exceptions in English: \" soccer \" and \" Celt \" are words that have / k / where / s / would be expected. The \"soft\" \u27e8c\u27e9 may represent the / \u0283 / sound in the digraph \u27e8ci\u27e9 when this precedes a vowel, as in the words 'delicious' and 'appreciate', and also in the word \"ocean\" and its derivatives. The digraph \u27e8 ch \u27e9 most commonly represents / t\u0283 / , but can also represent / k / (mainly in words of Greek origin) or / \u0283 / (mainly in words of French origin). For some dialects of English, it may also represent / x / in words like loch , while other speakers pronounce the final sound as / k / . The trigraph \u27e8tch\u27e9 always represents / t\u0283 / . The digraph \u27e8ck\u27e9 is often used to represent the sound / k / after short vowels, like \"wicket\". C is the eleventh least frequently used letter in the English language (after G , Y , P , B , V , K , J , X , Q , and Z ), with a frequency of about 2.20% in words.  Other languages  In the Romance languages French , Spanish , Italian , Romanian and Portuguese , \u27e8c\u27e9 generally has a \"hard\" value of /k/ and a \"soft\" value whose pronunciation varies by language. In French, Portuguese, Catalan and Spanish from Latin America and some places in Spain, the soft \u27e8c\u27e9 value is /s/ as it is in English.  In the Spanish spoken in most of Spain, the soft \u27e8c\u27e9 is a voiceless dental fricative  /\u03b8/ . In Italian and Romanian , the soft \u27e8c\u27e9 is [t\u0361\u0283] . All Balto-Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet, as well as Albanian , Hungarian , Pashto , several Sami languages , Esperanto , Ido , Interlingua , and Americanist phonetic notation (and those aboriginal languages of North America whose practical orthography derives from it) use \u27e8c\u27e9 to represent /t\u0361s/ , the voiceless alveolar or voiceless dental sibilant affricate . In Hanyu Pinyin , the standard romanization of Mandarin Chinese , the letter represents an aspirated version of this sound, /t\u0361s\u02b0/ . Among non-European languages that have adopted the Latin alphabet, \u27e8c\u27e9 represents a variety of sounds. Yup'ik , Indonesian , Malay , and a number of African languages such as Hausa , Fula , and Manding share the soft Italian value of /t\u0361\u0283/ .  In Azeri , Crimean Tatar , Kurmanji Kurdish , and Turkish \u27e8c\u27e9 stands for the voiced counterpart of this sound, the voiced postalveolar affricate  /d\u0361\u0292/ . In Yabem and similar languages, such as Bukawa , \u27e8c\u27e9 stands for a glottal stop  /\u0294/ . Xhosa and Zulu use this letter to represent the click /\u01c0/ . In some other African languages, such as Berber languages , \u27e8c\u27e9 is used for /\u0283/ . In Fijian , \u27e8c\u27e9 stands for a voiced dental fricative  /\u00f0/ , while in Somali it has the value of / \u0295 / . The letter \u27e8c\u27e9 is also used as a transliteration of Cyrillic \u27e8\u0446\u27e9 in the Latin forms of Serbian , Macedonian , and sometimes Ukrainian , along with the digraph \u27e8ts\u27e9.  Other systems  As a phonetic symbol, lowercase \u27e8 c \u27e9 is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and X-SAMPA symbol for the voiceless palatal plosive , and capital \u27e8C\u27e9 is the X-SAMPA symbol for the voiceless palatal fricative .  Digraphs  There are several common digraphs with \u27e8c\u27e9, the most common being \u27e8 ch \u27e9, which in some languages (such as German ) is far more common than \u27e8c\u27e9 alone. \u27e8ch\u27e9 takes various values in other languages. As in English, \u27e8ck\u27e9, with the value /k/ , is often used after short vowels in other Germanic languages such as German and Swedish (other Germanic languages, such as Dutch and Norwegian , use \u27e8kk\u27e9 instead). The digraph \u27e8cz\u27e9 is found in Polish and \u27e8cs\u27e9 in Hungarian, both representing /t\u0361\u0283/ . The digraph \u27e8sc\u27e9 represents /\u0283/ in Old English, Italian, and a few languages related to Italian (where this only happens before front vowels , while otherwise it represents /sk/ ). The trigraph \u27e8sch\u27e9 represents /\u0283/ in German.
